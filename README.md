Code for the model training is stored in final.py. Optuna training code is stored as dpm_optuna.py and corresponding sql db as db.sqlite3. The ASE db for the dataset is named as new_dataset70.db. Predicted values are stored in predicted200.csv. The trained model is inside the new_dataset70 folder names as best_inference_model_fold. A report for the model is attached in the PDF format. 

Additionally, we also calculated 2D and 3D descriptors relevant to the dipole moment and built various models to find a correlation to predict dipole moment accurately. These descriptors show poor correlation as dipole moment is a complex property which requires vector representations. The descriptors are stored in the file calculated_descriptors.csv.
