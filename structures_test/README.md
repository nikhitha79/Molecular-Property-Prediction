This folder contains the test dataset. Two dummy files mol_0 and mol_00 are used for dummy training and validation while predicting using the best model. These are just to fulfill the train and validation size criteria and does not alter the predictions in any manner as they are excluded from the actual test data while predicting. For prediction, use pred.py.
